Notify
======

SupCom mod that notifies teammates when RAS is done

To toggle Nofity's messages to chat, enter /enableNotifyChat or /disableNotifyChat into the chat
To toggle Notify's ETA world overlay, enter /enableNotifyOverlay or /disableNotifyOverlay into the chat
To toggle both of the above, enter /enableNotify or /disableNotify into the chat

To only toggle for the current game, and not save back to preferences, you can add "once" to the end of the previous commands (e.g., "/disableNotifyChat once")

Install the mod in mods/Notify i.e:

%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\mods\
