Hi, 

Thanks for downloading and using my mod.

what this mod does is split a group of units into subgroups

you can split any number of units into max 10 sub groups.

Installation:

Put the mod folder into your forged alliance mods folder, enable in the mod manager.
This is a UI mod.


HotKeys:

alt + shift + 0 - 9 will split the group into that number.
alt + 0 - 9 will select that group (if it exists)

if you select unit(s) not in a group, you can hold alt and left click a group icon to add those units to that group.
if you have a group unit selected you can press alt + s to select the whole group (squad) you can also click the group icon.

alt + c will remove the selected group units from there group, but you can also right click on the groups icon to remove them.
you can select a group unit and alt + left click one of the other groups icon and that unit will switch groups.

Enjoy!

Domino
