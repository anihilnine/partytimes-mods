version 4

This is a UI mod, you can play multiplayer without your opponents having it too.

Will automatically switch mass fabs on/off to try and maintain your energy levels. Mass fabs need to be set to auto switch with the UI panel due to this being a UI mod. This can be automatically done by right clicking the add all fabs button, but this isn't really recommended due to the workaround I'm forced to take to find mass fabs and keep the mod UI only. It will only update the list while you have nothing selected.

Installation:
extract to your \supreme commander forged alliance\mods\ folder, and activate the mod in the extras menu.


Updates:
v1: 	initial release.
v2: 	updated to use FA values, greatly improved swithing algorithm (no more need for a "panic" option etc...) now strives for efficiency (lonkero173 takes over)
v3:		fixed script to exclude paragon, you wont want that turned off when short on energy...
v4:		improved stability by assuming all active mass fabs to have full adjecency bonuses, while inactive ones have none. This guarantees that we do not underestimate the amount of energy we are about to use, or overestimate the amount freed up.
